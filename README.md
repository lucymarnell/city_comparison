# City Comparison Website

This project consists of a web visualization tool to find cities that are well-suited to the user's preferences. The data for this project was pulled from a kaggle dataset and cleaned, before being used to create visualizations in JavaScript. 

You can view the city comparison site [here](https://ds4200-s22.github.io/final-project-city-comparison/).
